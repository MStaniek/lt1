Please email your solution to langtech1saarlandws1617@gmail.com with the subject header **Exercise FFNN**, by **15:00, January 18, 2016**.  Please no Word documents or Zip files.

## Task A: Basics
The network for this task has two input nodes, one hidden layer consisting of two nodes, and one output node. It uses a ReLU activation function.
For the hidden layer, the weights for the first hidden node (from the input nodes) are (2.3, -0.64, 2). The last number is the weight for the bias term.
The weights for the second hidden node are (-3, -2, -1).
<!-- The weights for the third hidden node are (-1.1, 3, 0). -->
<!-- For the output layer, the weights are (5, 3, 0, -34). -->
For the output layer, the weights are (5, 3, -34).

Calculate the output for the following inputs (where the bias term is the last value of each vector).  Show your work.

1. (-4, -2, 1)
2. (0, -2, 1)
3. (4, -2, 1)
4. (0, -3, 1)


## Task B: Tensorflow Playground
Go to [Tensorflow Playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org) and play around with it for a little while.  You can start training by pressing the big 'play' button on the top left.  On simple datasets it should converge quickly, so you can pause training by pressing the same button.

1.  Starting with [this configuration](http://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=gauss&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.21483&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false), try to find the smallest network that correctly classifies the data.
Notice that you can adjust the number of hidden layers, as well as the number of neurons within each layer, as well as the activation function, and others.
What are the main hyperparameters that you set?
You can additionally optionally share a link to the URL containing your setup.
How long did it take to converge?

2. Now change the dataset (in the middle-left of the page) to the *exclusive-or* dataset (top-right).
What is the smallest network architecture you can use to correctly classify the data?
What are the main hyperparameters that you set?
How long did it take to converge?

3. Same for the *circle* dataset.
What is the smallest network architecture you can use to correctly classify the data?
How long did it take to converge?
How does changing the activation function affect the results?
How does changing the batch size affect the results?
How does changing the learning rate affect the results?
How does changing the noise affect the results?

4. Same for the *spiral* dataset.  Also, what is the best test loss that you saw?
How stable is it using different restarts (button to the left of the play button)?
How does changing the activation function affect the results?
How does changing the batch size affect the results?
How does changing the learning rate affect the results?
How does changing the regularization & regularization rate affect the results?


## Task C: Software
1. Install Keras:

         pip3 install --user keras

2. Read the overview of [Keras](https://keras.io) on the main page, and other documentation as needed.

3. Generate multiple two-dimensional random Gaussian distributions (like what was done in the log-linear homework), but this time generate the data such that one would need a non-linear classifier to learn the distribution.  Specifically, generate a Gaussian distribution of red dots centered at (0, 0), blue dots centered at (-4, 0), another blue distribution centered at (4, 0), and another blue distribution centered at (0, -4).

4. Create a small feedforward neural network to correctly learn this distibution, with a relatively low error rate / high accuracy rate.  You probably only need one or two hidden layers, with a few nodes per layer.  Report in your PDF submission the hyperparameters that you used, and the loss (accuracy or error rate) on a similar test set that you generated.

5. Either submit a link to your Github code, or upload the Python3 file as an attachment (but not in a zip file).
